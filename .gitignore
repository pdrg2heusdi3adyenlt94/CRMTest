# Examples 1:
# Project with only source/config files - no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files
# Expected output: (empty - output nothing)

# Example 2:
# Project with artifacts like pycache, dist, .env.local, .vscode
# Expected output includes compiled files, dependencies, logs, env files, editors

# In this case, only app/globals.css was modified, which is a source file
# No build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files detected in changes
# Therefore, no .gitignore rules are needed

# Output: (nothing)
